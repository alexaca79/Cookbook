Notes \(Bryan\):

I tend not to record the precise amounts of ingredients I use when cooking. Cooking, at least for myself, is about feeling and knowing. What works for some, may not work for others. People have different tastes. I'll try to give accurate numbers, but there are some ingredients where I just say Enough or Plenty. Changes in these two will determine the overall result, so do what you think is right.  When dealing with Enough or Plenty ingredients, I will state the usual amount I go with, to give you a ballpark figure.

E = Enough: the minimum amount of X ingredient that you are OK with. Example: If I recommend Enough rice wine, you can put a dash, a heavy handed pour, or none at all.

P = Plenty: the maximum amount of X ingredient that you are OK with. Example: Plenty coriander means quite a bit. One of my favourite herbs, I'm definitely OK with using a bit more than usual.

Philosophy for cooks by Plato \(not really\):

Recipes are guidelines and if you're making something you're uncomfortable with, then you're not going to put your heart into it. Experiment and have fun; even if the taste isn't quite there, you know what works now and what doesn't. Trial and error, my friends. But if you don't care about the food you're making, then why should the people tasting it?  Also, it would be a waste of ingredients and I hate people who don't respect not just the food, but the people who worked hard to get that ingredient to you.
