HERE IS HOW TO MAKE YOUR OWN VINAIGRETTE   

General rule. 3 Parts Oil to 1 Part Acid   

#### Acceptable Oils 
Extra Virgin Olive Oil (if it has little Italian catholic angels with wings on it on the label, chances are it's pretty decent)  
Avocado oil -> ITS NEUTRAL IN TASTE AND IT COMES FROM GOD's MAYO

1 cup Oil   
1-2 whole lemon (USE YOUR HANDS TO SWEEZEE dat juice)  
3-4 tablespoon soy sauce maybe 10 if you want a heart attack when your 21   
5 pinches of sesame seeds (BLACK ONES WHITE ONES IT DONT MATTER (but they do taste different)    
1 clove of minced garlic (optional if its DATE NIGHT)  
1/4 of a shallot minced. YEAH THATS RIGHT (optional: mini onion that is SHARPER)  
1 tablespoon of mustard. <- this helps as a binder for the oil and vinger 
Grate ginger. Again to taste GOTTA GET SOME OF DAT GINGER

### Angry ButterNUT Soup. ALL HAIL THE GOURD! 

1 butternut squash or 2 depends how thick you want a soup (SUB WITH ANY GOURD YOU LIKE OH YEAH!!)   
Veggie stock-> can use any kind of stock but we wanted to keep it vegan   
1 onion   
2-3 garlic cloves  
1 can of Coconut milk  
Coconut oil   
3 sprigs of thyme   
1-2 bay leaves depending on size  
Fresh parsley   
2 Thai chilies (want it spicier -> 1 tablespoon of LOGA's HOT SAUCE)  

1.	Skin and cube your butternut squash. About 1-2 inch chunks, doesn’t have to be artful but needs to be more or less the same size.  Ideally you want to fill squash to the brim of the pot you have 
2.	Mince garlic and dice onion (smaller the better) 
3.	Take a good pot – whatever you got and put in on some high high heat. Add coconut oil bring it up to temperature (to tell if it’s at temperature sprinkle water it should make a crazy SHHIIHIHIH sound) and put in garlic and onions. Cook till onions are clear no more than 5-6 minutes.
4.	Once onions are clear, add in squash in batches. Add some squash, let to squash coat in oil and add more squash. Do this till you have filled your pot with the squash. Then turn down to medium and cover. Let that pumpkin steam for a bit ad get acquainted with the garlic and onions (2-3 minutes) 
5.	Uncover the pot. And add your stock up to the same level as the pumpkin. No more no less.  Add in your herbs at this point so chopped parsley, 1-2 bay leaves and whole thyme 2-3 sprigs. Let that soup come to a boil and then reduce to a simmer. (about medium low heat) 
6.	check back around 15-20 minutes. if the pumpkin is soft and mushy, great! Add in chopped Thai chili. Smaller the better. 
7.	Now take your hand blender and BLEND ALL THAT GOODNESS. Should be a velvet like consistency
8.	Now try the soup. You haven’t salted it so add salt to taste.  This is the point you should add the coconut milk. And then blend a bit more till its all homogeneous 
9.	Keep that on simmer for another 5-10 
10.	Serve with chopped chives and a bit of sour cream. Maybe a line of maple syrup. Garnish it however you like.
