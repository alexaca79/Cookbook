# I love sandwiches. Always Have. Always. Will. 

I'm not here to debate this, but these sandwich recipes can make the doomsday clock go to 12. Eat with caution. 

The Croque Californian <- My greatest Achievement. 

Pork Belly Sandwich 

The NO FUSS BaconLTE (BACON AS FAST AS YOUR CELL PHONE INTERNET)

THE ZUCCINI 

Lox and cream Cheese < - No edits on this one. It's perfect how it is
